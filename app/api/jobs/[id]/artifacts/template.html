            <h1>Full-stack Developer (Backend Focus) - Mindpeak, Hamburg</h1>
            <p>Dear Mindpeak Hiring Team,</p>
            <p>Helping clinicians see signals faster is why I build software. Mindpeak's mission to bring explainable AI
                to cancer diagnostics resonates with me, and I am excited to apply as a Full-stack Developer (Backend
                Focus). With 6+ years in TypeScript and 5+ years in React/Node.js, I design robust APIs and data flows
                and ship production UI that clinicians can trust.</p>
            <p>At webfoersterei I built frontend apps with Angular and Bootstrap, collaborated on REST route design, and
                automated deployments with Jenkins. Since then I have focused on API-first development with Node.js and
                modern React/Next.js frontends, integrating services and databases (4+ years with MongoDB) to deliver
                reliable features end to end. Those foundations translate well to your backend-heavy work: building
                secure services, modeling data thoughtfully, and integrating with ML inference endpoints via clean,
                well-documented APIs. What draws me to Mindpeak is the real-world impact and the rigor behind it - your
                focus on explainable AI and partnerships with leaders like Paige, PathAI, and ZEISS show a commitment to
                scalable, trusted solutions. I thrive in cross-functional settings and communicate clearly with
                engineering, product, and QA peers, and I am eager to collaborate with ML colleagues to turn research
                into usable products. While your backend centers on Python, I bring transferable backend skills, am
                comfortable interfacing with Python services, and I am motivated to deepen my Python proficiency as
                needed.</p>
            <p>I bring an API-first mindset, strong TypeScript/Node skills, and React/Next.js experience to accelerate
                integration around your AI models and data pipelines. I can help define clear service boundaries,
                document interfaces, and ship reliable features with CI (Jenkins), enabling faster, safer iterations in
                diagnostics workflows. I am ready to learn and adopt your Docker/Kubernetes workflows quickly.</p>
            <p>API-first backend development (5+ years in Node.js/REST); frontend integration with React/Next.js for
                cohesive end-to-end delivery (5+ and 3+ years); data modeling with MongoDB (4+ years) with readiness to
                adapt to PostgreSQL/MySQL; CI with Jenkins; clear, concise communication and strong motivation for
                healthcare AI.
                I would welcome the chance to discuss how I can contribute to Mindpeak's mission. I operate in UTC+1 and
                can start within 14 days. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>Ole K&ouml;ster</p>
